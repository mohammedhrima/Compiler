- TODOS:
    - Data types:
        - int
        - char 
        - arrays
        - float

    - Operators:
        - math:
            - negative numbers
            + +, -, ()
            - *, /:
        - comparision:
            - boolean
            - < > == !=
        - logic:
            - && || !
    
    - assignement:
        - += -= *= /=

    - implement BigInt, BigFloat

- loops, statments
- return keyword (there is limit of exit status)

- functions:
    - function call
        - before calling function push rbp to the stack and pop it later
        - each function has its own rbp
    - with lot of parameters:
        - use the stack
    - built ins functions:
        - output
    - send params by refrence or value
- variables by level
- add tester to expected output
- set estimation for each lable how much will take from rsp
- data type methods
- OOP shit:
    - operators overloading
    - class data types: 
        - bigInt / bigfloat (optimized version of each known data type)
- memory management:
    heap / stack !!!
- web server using it
- 2nd version bdarija
- pacman, snack game (using volkan)
- web framework maybe !!
