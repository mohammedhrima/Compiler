- TODOS:
    - Data types:
        - int:  
            - (check MAX_INT, MIN_INT, ...)
        - char:
            - Parsing:
                - \n, \t, \r
            - NULL
        - float:
            - (check MAX_FLT, MIN_FLT, ...)
        - arrays

    - Operators:
        - math operators:
            - negative numbers
            + +, -, ()
            - *, /:
        - logic operators:
            - < > == !=
        - assignement:
            - += -= *= /=

    - loops, statments
    
    - functions:
        - function call
            - before calling function push rbp to the stack and pop it later
            - each function has its own rbp
        - with lot of parameters:
            - use the stack
        - built ins functions:
            - output
    - variables by level
    - add tester to expected output
    - set estimation for each lable how much will take from rsp
    - data type methods
    - OOP shit:
        - operators overloading
        - class data types: 
            - bigInt / bigfloat (optimized version of each known data type)
    - memory management:
        heap / stack !!!
    - web server using it
    - 2nd version bdarija
    - pacman, snack game (using volkan)
    - web framework maybe !!

- Error handeling:
    - forgot " or '
    - unknown data type
    - tab level after :
    - protect rsp

=================================================================================
- NOTES:
    + testb : 'and' bitwise operator
    + write system call:
        rdi : fd
        rsi : pointer
        rdx : length
